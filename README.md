## 🧩 Problem Statement  

Urban professionals often struggle to find **safe, affordable, and community-driven co-living spaces**.

- Identified top **pain points**:  
  - High brokerage fees and hidden costs  
  - Lack of verified property data  
  - Difficulty finding compatible flatmates  
  - Absence of community and convenience features  

- Synthesized insights into **user personas, empathy maps, and journey flows** to define the MVP scope.
